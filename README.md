# library-app
A simple library app employing Javascript CSS and HTML to demonstrate object construction, iteration, manipulation, and display of object data in an HTML table. The app displays an HTML form when +Add Book is clicked. When the form inputs are valid, the form data is passed through an object constuctor to create a new book object. That book object is then added to an array. A function loops through the array to display each book object as a row in a library table, with each of the object's values displayed as that row's cell data. One of the cells created is a 'Read?' checkbox indicating if that book has or has not been read. The check status of the checkbox alters the book object's read: key/value pair. This is accomplished by creating a data-id attribute on the 'Read?' cell of the table that is associated with the book's array index. Another cell is a delete cell with a trash can image. This cell also gets a data-id associated with its book's array index. When the image is clicked, the book object is removed from the array and the new array without the deleted book is displayed on the table. The form itself appears by creating an overlay whose height is 0 and overflow is hidden until the +Add Book button is clicked. When +Add Book is clicked, the form get a new class that makes the overlay visible. The form dissapears when the form is submitted or the user clicks out of the form, changing the overlay's class back to the class that renders it invisible.
